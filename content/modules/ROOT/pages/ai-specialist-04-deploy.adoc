= Model Serving

The Model Serving Phase is where a validated machine learning model is prepared for production use. It ensures seamless deployment, reproducibility, and scalability while maintaining accountability.

Key aspects to take into account while AI Model releasing:

* *Versioning and Registry*: The model is versioned in a registry with metadata like training data, performance metrics, and hyperparameters. This step was already done by the Kubeflow Pipeline by publishing the model into the OpenShift AI Model Registry.
* *Packaging*: The model and its dependencies are prepared for consistent execution by containerizing them or converting them into standardized formats like ONNX or TorchScript. During the workshop, we demonstrated how to "export" the model from its native PyTorch format into other formats. For instance, TorchScript is particularly well-suited for edge deployments due to its compact size and efficiency. However, for simplicity in this workshop, you will continue using the native PyTorch file format. This approach ensures flexibility while allowing you to explore the practical benefits of exporting models in production scenarios.
* *Validation*: Additional tests, such as performance, integration, and scalability, are conducted in staging environments to ensure the model meets production requirements. In this workshop, we will perform a simple live test of the model to verify its functionality before proceeding with full deployment to edge devices.
* *Deployment*: Techniques like blue-green or canary deployments are commonly used to ensure a smooth and reliable transition to production. While OpenShift AI offers Model Serving capabilities through `KServe` and `ModelMesh` for models within the same cluster, deploying inference on a different environment—such as a Single Node OpenShift cluster or directly on Red Hat Enterprise Linux—requires a separate workflow to handle model transfer and deployment. 
* *Monitoring*: Metrics such as latency, resource usage, and data drift are continuously tracked to ensure the model's performance remains optimal. However, when deploying models at the Edge, the monitoring tools provided by OpenShift AI (e.g., TrustyAI, Grafana) cannot be used directly. Alternative monitoring strategies suited for Edge environments will be explored in detail in the next section.


OpenShift AI provides robust serving platforms to deploy models as inference endpoints:

* Single-model serving (https://github.com/kserve/kserve[`KServe`]): Designed for large models requiring dedicated resources.

* Multi-model serving (https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh[`ModelMesh`]): Optimized for small and medium-sized models sharing resources.

We can use those to deploy our models in the same OpenShift cluster where the OpenShift AI platform is running but, as mentioned, these options could not be directly available for your edge use case, remember that for our use case the MLOps workflow diagram is:

image::ai-build-rhoai-features.png[]

If you are using https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/microshift[Microshfit] or OpenShift at the Edge you can use the `Kserve` Custom Resource Definitions but if you plan to deploy your model directly on RHEL, without a Kubernetes API, you will need to use a different approach, for example running containers directly with Podman using https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/quadlet-podman[Quadlets] to configure them. 

In any case you also have to take some decisions. We've already explored several options for deploying a model, for example, you can use the model file directly with an inference server running on your system, run the inference server inside a container, use a container image that bundles both the model and the inference server, or run separate containers for the model and the inference server (this is what we are doing in this workshop). But there are other decisions to be taken besides how to distribute the model, for example if you want to do the model serving with an off-the-self (or vendor-backed) inference server or use one custom server created add-hoc, each has it's own pros and cons.

Vendor-backed inference servers offer several advantages. They are typically feature-rich, providing built-in capabilities such as model management, versioning, and performance optimization. They also come with out-of-the-box support for popular machine learning frameworks, which simplifies integration. Additionally, they significantly reduce development effort, allowing teams to focus more on deploying and scaling rather than building infrastructure from scratch.

However, these solutions also have downsides. They tend to consume more system resources due to their general-purpose nature and extensive feature sets. Customization options can be limited, as these tools are often designed to fit broad use cases. There's also a level of dependency on the vendor, which can impact flexibility and long-term support strategies.

On the other hand, custom inference servers are optimized for specific use cases, making them lightweight and highly flexible. They allow you to tailor performance and resource usage precisely to your needs. But this comes at the cost of increased development and maintenance effort. They typically offer fewer features and require self-support, which may not be ideal for teams without strong in-house expertise.

In this workshop we will be using an off-the-self inference server, https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server[Triton Server], more specifically the https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-triton-inference-server-boosts-deep-learning-inference/[one provided by NVIDIA]. Triton uses the KServe community standard inference protocols to define HTTP/REST and GRPC APIs plus several extensions so it is a good fit.


As an AI specialist, you won’t be deploying directly to edge devices, but you can still deploy your model—along with an inference server—on your OpenShift cluster to conduct meaningful testing. In fact, you can go a step further and deploy the entire service architecture to perform end-to-end testing, allowing you to observe how your model behaves within a realistic, production-like environment.

In this section, we will explore how to deploy our model and examine the inference performance. After that you will also deploy the associated microservices to do an end-to-end validation of the architecture used for the workshop use case. This architecture leverages the model's predictions to create a system that raises alarms when individuals are not wearing hardhats.

=== Tools and preparations

We’ll use the following tools:

* OpenShift AI: To deploy and monitor the Inference Server

* Quay Container Image Registry: Where we have our `modelcar` container image

* OpenShift: To deploy the use case microservices that work along with the inference server to provide an end-to-end solution.



== Inference testing

image::ai-deploy-nav1.png[]

Let's dive into deploying the Inference Server with our model! 


=== Inferencing with OpenShift AI










[example]
====
1- Go to https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift AI]

2- Move to "Data Science Projects"

3- Go to the `{user}--test`

4- Click the "Models" tab

5- Select "single-model" platform

image::ai-deploy-single-model-server.png[]

====









[example]
====
1- Go to https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift AI]

2- Move to "Model Registry" and select your model

3- Click on the version that you want to test

4- Copy the OCI URI

5- Select "Deploy" in the "Actions" dropdown menu on the top right corner

6- Select the project that you just created and fill-in the form:

* Model name: `hardhat-test` (we use that name in a Job below)

* Serving runtime: `NVIDIA Triton Server v25.01`

* Framework: `onnx - 1.20.1`

* Accelerator: If you have GPUs available choose your accelerator.

* Make deployed models available through an external route: `selected`

* Require token authentication: `not selected`

* Create a new connection:

  * Connection type: `URI - v1`
  * Conection name: I suggest something like `<modelcar-name>-<tag>`
  * URI: Paste here the OCI URI that you copied

image::ai-build-deploy-model-registry.png[]

7- Click "Deploy"

====

[NOTE] 

The Inference Server may take some time to become available upon initial deployment. Please note that you may need to refresh the page to confirm whether the server has been successfully deployed.

If you want to see the deployment progress or check the Inference Server logs you can go to the https://console-openshift-console.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift Console] and check "Workloads > Pods". If you click on the Pod's name you will have access to the "Events" and "Logs".

he Pod consists of four containers and one init container. You can view the logs for each by selecting them from the dropdown menu, which defaults to `kserve-container`. In the `modelcar-init` container, you can observe how the model file is copied from the container image—created by the OpenShift Pipeline—to the Inference Server. To monitor the Inference Server itself, check the logs in the `kserve-container`. Once the server is fully initialized, you should see a log entry similar to the following:

image::ai-deploy-inference-logs.png[]


When the Inference server appears as avialable in the https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift AI] console, you will be able to copy the endpoint that we need to use to access to it (copy the "external" endpoint).

image::ai-deploy-serving-endpoint.png[]


Now that the Inference Server is running and you have the endpoint needed to access it, let’s deploy a test application that uses the server to tag a set of images.

[example]
====

1- Go to the "Administrator" view in the https://console-openshift-console.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift Console]

2- Click on the `+` button on the top right corner of the UI to deploy a new YAML file

3- Be sure that you are in the right project (`{user}--test`) and paste the following YAML

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]

4- Change the `<CHANGE ME TO INFERENCE ENDPOINT>` string with the external endpoint value that you copied from the deployed Inference Server

5- Click "Create"

6- Wait until the POD is in "Running" status and then move to "Networking > Routes"

7- Open the application's URL
====

You’ll see a UI with the endpoint of your Inference Server pre-selected. You can now upload images of people wearing or not wearing hard hats to the application (for example, images from the "Test" set of your dataset), then click "Submit".

[CAUTION]

Make sure the uploaded images do not show `0 KB` in size. Chrome does not support drag-and-drop in all contexts, and depending on where the files are stored on your computer, they may fail to upload.

The inference process may take some time depending on the number of images and whether you're using a GPU. Once it completes, you should see a result similar to the following:

image::ai-deploy-test-app-inference.png[]

As you can see, hardhats were detected on the images, so we are good to promote this model as the "production" model.

[NOTE]

If you are interested on it, you can find the https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/tree/main/resources/assets/model_test_apps/object-detection-api/kserve-api/src[test application source code here]


=== Promoting model to production

How do you promote a model to production? The approach depends on how you plan to distribute it. In our case, we are distributing the model as a `modelcar`, which is essentially a dedicated container image. Promoting the model becomes straightforward: it's as simple as assigning the correct container image tag to the image you wish to use. For example, you can use a `prod` tag for the model intended for production. To do this, you’ll need to select the container image with the model you’ve just created and apply the appropriate tag. Let’s take a look at how to do this in Quay.

[example]
====

1- Go to https://workshop-registry-quay-openshift-operators.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[Quay Container Image Registry]

2- Click on the `modelcar` container image name

3- Click on the labels icon on the left menu

4- Click on the gear icon on the right and  select "Add new tag"

5- Assign the `prod` tag to that image


image::ai-deploy-promote.png[]

====


== End-to-End Validation




















image::ai-deploy-nav2.png[]


So far, you have completed the AI Specialist's tasks by creating the model and taken on some Application Development responsibilities by manually building the container images. Now, before handing over to the Platform Specialist for deploying the applications to the Edge devices, it's a good idea to perform a final test of the model you created. Let’s deploy all the components together and verify if everything works as expected.

For this test, we will use your own laptop as the "Edge Device", but in contrast with the "production" architecture you will be only running the "Camera Stream Manager" on it. The rest of the services will be deployed in the cloud-side applications in a temporary OpenShift project, which can easily be deleted after the testing is complete.

















=== Overview of the solution













mlops diagram















Before diving into the deployment details, let’s first understand the overall solution architecture, including the microservices involved and how they communicate. In this architecture we use a webcam to detect objects at the edge, and how those detections can trigger messages/alarms that can be visualized in a dashboard on the Core Datacenter/Cloud.


image::ai-deploy-object-detection-webcam.png[]

The solution is based on the following microservices, you can clik on the names to get detailed information about each one:

* https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-stream-manager[Camera Stream Manager]

* Inference server

* https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-action[Actuator service]

* https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-dashboard/src/backend[Dashboard backend]

* https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-dashboard/src/frontend[Dashboard frontend]


The workflow is the following:

1. The Camera Stream Manager sends images to the Inference API
2. The Inference Server, that contains the AI model detecting objects, returns the predictions
3. The "Action" service calls the inference endpoint and if detects certain objects it will trigger an alarm, that is sent to the database hosted in a remote site.
4. The information of the device is shown in the Dashboard








=== Cloud-side Applications deployment


[NOTE]

Instructions below are using the provided pre-created container images, but you can use your own images if you created them in the previous step.


[example]
====
Follow the steps below to create the https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-dashboard/src/backend[Dashboard backend] and https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-dashboard/src/frontend[Dashboard frontend] applications in OpenShift:


1- Navegate to the "Administrator" view in the https://console-openshift-console.apps.{ocp_cluster_url}[OpenShift Console]

2- Log in using your OpenShift credentials: {openshift-user}  /  {openshift-password}.

3- Be sure that you are in the (`{user}--test`) project

4- Click on the `+` icon on the top right corner of the OpenShift console.

5- Paste there the content shown below to deploy the Dashboard Backend and Click "Create".

6- Open the "Route" object and take note of the Dashboard Frontend URL.

====


When all pods are running, you will be able to open the Dashboard using the Frontend URL. You will see an empty page with the "Device Monitoring Dashboard" title.

[CAUTION]

The Dashboard application does not use TLS, so the URL must start `http://` and `https://` otherwhile you will get a message "Application is not available" even when then POD is already running.




















1- Deploy the Inference Server:

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
podman run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/luisarizmendi/object-detection-inference-server:prod
----

[NOTE]

This is a large image, the pull could take time

If you have an https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/cdi-support.html[NVIDA GPU and you have it configured in your system] (`sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml`), you might want to use it for inferencing by running `podman run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --security-opt=label=disable quay.io/luisarizmendi/object-detection-inference-server:prod`


2- Now you can check that the GPU is being detected by checking the `healthz` endpoint, see an example below.

----
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
{"status":"healthy","gpu_available":true,"model_loaded":true,"model_name":"1","timestamp":"2025-01-28T22:34:31.102136"}
----









4- Deploy the Actuator. It needs also to use the host network. Also you will need to include the Dashboard backend route. Please, don't forget the `/alert` and `/alive` as part of the environment variable value.

----
podman run -it --rm --network=host -e ALERT_ENDPOINT=<DASHBOARD_BACKEND_OCP_ROUTE>/alert -e ALIVE_ENDPOINT=<DASHBOARD_BACKEND_OCP_ROUTE>/alive quay.io/luisarizmendi/object-detection-action:prod
----








=== Local machine applications deployment

You’ve successfully deployed the cloud-side applications! Now, take the next step by running the remaining applications on your own laptop

[NOTE]

Instructions for Fedora/RHEL based systems and using the interactive mode, so you can review live logs easily (you will need to use three different command line terminals).

[CAUTION]

Be sure that you have the ports `tcp/8080` and `tcp/5000` ports open un your local machine. 

[example]
====
3- Deploy the Camera stream manager. In this case you will need to run it as privileged to access the system devices (webcams) and also to use the host network, so it can reach out to the inference server.

[source,shell,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
sudo podman run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 --privileged --network=host quay.io/luisarizmendi/object-detection-stream-manager:prod
----

[NOTE]

This won't work for MAC users since camera access from containers is different in that OS. If you are a MAC user you can still run this service by downloading and running directly the https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-stream-manager/src/object-detection-stream-manager.py[`object-detection-stream-manager.py` python script] on your system with `python object-detection-stream-manager.py`. Remember to install the https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/blob/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps/object-detection-stream-manager/src/requirements.txt[python dependencies] with `pip install` and to grant permissions to access cameras if needed.

====


[NOTE]

You will see logs directly in the console terminal. The Inference Server may already be displaying detection results, and if a `no_helmet` detection occurs, the "actuator" will trigger an alarm. Additionally, the Camera Stream Manager logs important details at startup, such as the selected webcam ID, providing useful insights for debugging and verification












==== The Convenient Yet Non-Edge Test Architecture

Inferencing with a CPU can be slow. However, if you have an NVIDIA GPU in your laptop, you can deploy the Inference Server using it, as demonstrated in the previous step. But what if you don’t have one?

You have two options:

Stick to the Edge Computing setup, accepting slower frame detection. While not ideal, my tests have shown it remains functional.

Leverage an OpenShift Cluster with GPUs (if available through this workshop). This allows you to deploy the Inference Server in the Cloud instead of your local machine for testing.

While the second option provides faster inferencing, it is not a true Edge Computing architecture. [.underline]*Sending images from the edge to the Cloud introduces network delays and additional costs*, two key drawbacks that edge computing is designed to mitigate. However, for a quick test, it offers a practical way to achieve high-speed inferencing.

[NOTE]

This deployment is also useful for comparing Edge vs. Non-Edge setups. You can test with or without a GPU in both environments to evaluate user experience, delays, and performance trade-offs.

Now, let’s examine the [.underline]*non-edge architecture* we’ll set up for testing. As you can see, the difference comparing it with the "pure" edge deployment is where the Inference Server is located.


image::ai-deploy-noy-edge-arch.png[]

[example]
====
Let's deploy this architecture:

1- Start by the Inference Server. In this case we will need the Kubernetes manifests that we will apply in OpenShift (you can use the project that you created, `{user}--test`):


[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]

----


2- Wait until the POD is in `Running` state.

3- Go to routes and take note of the Inference Server route. Now you can check that the GPU is being detected by checking the `healthz` endpoint, see an example below.

----
curl http://inference-server-user99-test.apps.cluster-2cndn.2cndn.sandbox73.opentlc.com/healthz
{"status":"healthy","gpu_available":true,"model_loaded":true,"model_name":"1","timestamp":"2025-01-28T22:34:31.102136"}
----

4- You still need to deploy the other services locally (although you could also potentially deploy the Actuator in the cloud too), but there is a difference on how you deploy the Camera Stream Manager, since you need to indicate the URL endpoint for the Inference Server (by default it uses `localhost`). You can do it by using the `INFERENCE_SERVER_URL` environment variable (it will be something similar to `http://inference-server-user99-test.apps.cluster-2cndn.2cndn.sandbox73.opentlc.com`).

----
sudo podman run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 --privileged -e INFERENCE_SERVER_URL=<INFERENCE_SERVER_OCP_ROUTE> quay.io/luisarizmendi/object-detection-stream-manager:prod
----

5- Deploy the Actuator. 

----

=== Testing workflow

As part of the workshop materials, hardhats should be provided. If you don’t have one, you can use a cycling helmet, though this may reduce detection accuracy.

[NOTE]

For this initial test, you will start without wearing a hardhat.



[example]
====
Once all services are up and running, follow these steps to validate the system:


1- Open `http://localhost:5000/video_stream`. You should see the camera feed displaying a `no_helmet` detection.

2- Open the Dashboard Frontend URL. If the camera has already detected anything (`helmet` or `no_helmet`), you will see a device listed with your MAC address as the Device Name.


3- Since the camera is detecting no_helmet, an alarm icon will appear next to your device name.

4- Put on the hardhat and observe how the system detects it in the video stream. After a few seconds, the alarm should disappear.

5- Click on your Device Name to view detailed information, including logged alarms. You can also rename the device to give it a more user-friendly name.

=== Promoting model to production
















== Solution and Next Steps

In this step, you have completed key application development tasks, including building container images for the required applications. The code and corresponding Container files for each application can be found in the https://github.com/luisarizmendi/workshop-moving-ai-to-the-edge/tree/main/resources/solutions/ai-specialist/serving/apps[`serving/apps` directory of the `ai-specialist` solution resources].


At this stage, you are well-positioned to hand over the solution to the xref:platform-specialist-00-intro.adoc[Platform Specialist] for deployment on Edge Devices. However, if you prefer to skip that step or have already completed it in a previous part of the workshop, you can proceed to the final task for the AI Specialist: the xref:ai-specialist-05-update.adoc[Day-2 Operations] section.

Do not remove the services that you deployed for your model testing since you will need it in the next section.
